Siteswap.js
===========

A siteswap generator and animator in Javascript!

**NOTE:** Currently does not compute transition throws for excited state patterns -- it will somewhat comically drop the balls if it animates an excited state or invalid siteswap.

TODO
----
- Rotate siteswap into standard orientation (ie. 345 -> 534)
- Compute transition throws for excited state patterns
